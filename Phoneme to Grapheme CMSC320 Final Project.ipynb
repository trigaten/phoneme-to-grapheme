    "In a world where humanity never developed language, would humans still have been able to communicate with the precision required to convey advanced knowledge to other humans? Without language, many of today's inventions and scientific progression\" would never have existed. An evolutionary biologist went as far as to the creation of language as \"the most important evolutionary invention of the last few million years\" (Nowak 2000). Language allows humans to communicate information with a level of precision that no other animal on earth can replicate. According to psychologists and historians, rational thought can happen without language, but communicating and continuing these ideas through generations are the central tendencies that allow humans to cooperate, develop, and thrive across the globe.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oxford Dictionary describes linguistics as \"the scientific study of language and its structure, including the study of morphology, syntax, phonetics, and semantics\". From that definition, morphology is the study of words, whose smallest character building blocks are graphemes, and phonetics is the pronunciations of those words and graphemes (Oxford English Dictionary 2021). Most humans can process and recognize words based on their oral pronunciation in their local dialect, but oral communication is not the sole form of communication. In this project, we will be focusing solely on the importance and applications of oral communication and phonetics in Artificial Intelligence using Recurrent Neural Networks"

    "### Why Predict Words and Graphemes?\n",
    "Today's speech recognition systems use varying techniques. However, many of the most commonly used speech recognition systems such as Bixby, Siri, Alexa, and Google do not attempt to spell words outside the system's dictionary. For example, a person's name may be easy to pronounce but may have unusual spelling. A food's name may be unique and not listed in dictionaries. To give systems like these a boost in their range of responses, we proposed implementing a new system that attempts to predict graphemes when the word confidence is below a certain threshold."

    "### Our Project\n",
    "Our project aims to predict graphemes from phonemes. After our project completes, the next step is to map audio to phonemes, which would allow a speaker to say any English word that has phonetics and have the model produce a word spelled the way the word sounds. If the model outputs incorrect results, we believe that a robust autocorrect library would often correct the attempted word into the correct word. As a result, we believe that converting phonemes to graphemes is a step towards technology having an enhanced ability to recognize speech and produce text that closely resembles the phonetics of speech, providing enhanced communication between users and computational devices and evolution of communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Webscraping and Cleaning Phonetics\n",
    "We chose to web scrape phonetics from two web sources: merriam-webster.com and dictionary.com. However, we attempted\n",
    "multiple pdf sources, which did not yield good results. Our code allows for switching between websites by simply\n",
    "adding a new source in the identified code section. However, after reviewing the data, we discovered that dictionary\n",
    ".com produced better and more consistent results and decided to choose the website as our sole source of data\n",
    "collection. Unfortunately, the structure of the phonetics section of the web pages was not entirely consistent across\n",
    " different words. This inconsistency required us to write code that handled various new edge cases to confirm that\n",
    " our CSV (comma-separated values file) would only contain correct data. We initially used synchronous methods of\n",
    " acquiring data. However, concurrency reduced the program runtime by nearly 75%, as determined by runtime logging. The performance increase allows users to collect data significantly faster, allowing for a larger dataset better finetuning of our model. As a result, we acquired over 78,000 word-phonetic combinations for use with our model."
